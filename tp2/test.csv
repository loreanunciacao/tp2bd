ABSTRACT Designing three-dimensional (3D) surfaces is difficult in both the physical world  and in 3D modeling software, requiring background knowledge and skill. The goal of this  work is to make 3D surface design easier and more accessible through natural and  .."

Y Kawano, K Yanaka - 3D User Interfaces (3DUI), 2013 IEEE  , 2013 - ieeexplore.ieee.org. ABSTRACT We present a new system that can input and output integral photography  images. The system consists of a commerciallyavailable tablet PC to which fly's eye lenses,  one of which is for input and the other for output IP images, are attached. Light rays  .."
